This module allows the user to link multiple products, product
categories or product templates to a lead or an opportunity in order to
be able to do a product demand forecasting taking into account the leads
and opportunities defined in Odoo.

Included in the product line there are two computed fields, the expected
revenue and prorated revenue. On one hand, the expected revenue is
computed as the selling price times the quantity. On the other hand, the
prorated revenue takes into account the probability of the opportunity
and is computed as the planned revenue times the probability.

The module also includes a reporting section where the user can easily
see in a pivot and graph view the relationship between products, stage
of the lead/opportunity and the expected or prorated revenue for that
product.
