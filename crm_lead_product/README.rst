This module allows the user to link multiple products, product categories or product templates to a lead or an opportunity
in order to be able to do a product demand forecasting taking into account the leads and opportunities defined in odoo.
Included in the product line there are two computed fields, the planned revenue and expected revenue. On one hand, the
planned revenue is computed as the selling price times the quantity. On the other hand, the expected revenue takes into account
the probability of the opportunity and is computed as the planned revenue times the probability.

The module also includes a reporting section where the user can easily see in a pivot and graph view the relationship
between products, stage of the lead/opportunity and the planned or expected revenue for that product.
