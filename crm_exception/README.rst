This module allows you to attach several customizable exceptions to your opportunities.
You can also define an exception rule to be applied to specific CRM stages.

Configuration
=============

**To configure CRM exception rule:**

#. Create a new exception rule.
#. Select "Lead" in the "Apply On" field (the 'stage_ids' field will be displayed).
#. Choose the CRM stage to which you want to apply the exception rule.
#. Specify the exception type and define the condition, then save the rule.

**Note:** 
If you don't specify a CRM stage for stage_ids (leave it blank), the rule will be checked at every stage.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

**No Exception checking in the create function.**

Adding exception checking to the create function would trigger an Odoo Client Error
related to JavaScript (Error: Component is destroyed) when attempting to create a new opportunity
in the pipeline's kanban view and clicking the edit button.
