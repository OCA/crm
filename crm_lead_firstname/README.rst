This module extends the functionality of CRM leads to support split first and
last name fields for contacts and allow you to port that information to and
from partners.
Since leads are expected to create partners only when needed and after
information is correctly set up, in leads there is no inverse logic to
transform the old single name in the new split names automatically. The old
single name will simply be the firstname now.
