Since leads are expected to create partners only when needed and after
information is correctly set up, in leads there is no inverse logic to

single name will simply be the firstname now.

To install this module, you need to:

* Install `OCA/partner-contact <https://github.com/OCA/partner-contact>`_ repo.
