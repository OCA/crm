==========
CRM Action
==========

This module was written to extend CRM features.
It delivers new object named "Actions" to follow history around leads and
opportunities.

Installation
============

Just install the module as usual (it only depends on the native *crm* module).

Configuration
=============

Go to the menu *Sales > Configuration > Leads & Opportunities > Action Types*
and create action types.

If you want to have a daily email reminder of your CRM actions to do, go to
the menu *Settings > Technical > Automation > Scheduled Actions* and activate
the action *CRM Action email reminder* (it is inactive by default). You can
customize the email template in the menu *Settings > Technical > Email >
Templates* and select the email template named *CRM Action reminder*.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to :

1. create a lead or an opportunity,
#. create a new action by using the *Actions* button,
#. when the action is done, click on the button *Mark as done*.

You can overview all actions for any lead or opportunity with the *Actions*
menu entry. On the form view of an opportunity, you can see the next action to
do and there is also a button to mark it as done (it will immediately display
the new next action to do).
