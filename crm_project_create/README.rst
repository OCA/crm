It will be useful for you if you want to create a project before
creating a quotation and confirming it or if you want to estimate, plan
or know if you have the capacity before making the sale.

3. Click on **Create project** in header.
4. A wizard is shown to fill project name and/or project description.
5. Click on **Create project**.
6. You can see project created in page **Extra Information**, inside
