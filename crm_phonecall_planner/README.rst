Use this module to plan a phone calls schedule for your partners, assuming you
have specified the ideal time to call them.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

To use this module, you need to specify your partners' preferred phone call
schedule:

#. Go to any partner's form > *Phone Calls*.
#. Set the preferred phone calling schedule for the partner.
#. Repeat above steps for all of your partners.

Usage
=====

Now, to actually generate the phone call planning:

#. Go to *Sales > Phone Calls > Planner*.
#. Fill the fields under *Call details*. Those fields will be saved literally
   in the generated phone calls.
#. Fill the fields under *Criteria*. Those fields are used to filter the
   partners and the preexisting calls. The UTM fields will also be saved
   literally in the generated phone calls.
#. Fill the fields under *Times*. See note below.
#. Fill the fields under *Repetition*. See note below.
#. Press *Generate planning*.
#. Wait a little bit (this is usually a long process).
#. You will get to the list of planned phone calls. Start calling!

Note about *Times* section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *Start* and *End* times behave in a special way:

* Their *date* part is used to know the start and end dates for the planning.
* Their *time* part is used to know the time at which we will plan calls *each
  day under the date range*.

The *Call duration* field indicates the time spacing you want to leave between
one call and the next one.

So, for instance, if you select start on *2017-09-01 09:00:00*, end on
*2017-09-03 10:00:00* and duration of *1:00*, it will try to generate these
phone calls:

* 2017-09-01 09:00:00
* 2017-09-01 10:00:00
* 2017-09-02 09:00:00
* 2017-09-02 10:00:00
* 2017-09-03 09:00:00
* 2017-09-03 10:00:00

Note about *Repetition* section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you choose not to repeat calls, the planner will try to schedule one single
phone call for each **criteria combination** (*Partner + Campaign + Source +
Medium*) under the specified conditions in the *Times* section (see note above).

If you choose instead to repeat calls after some amount of days (*Days gap*),
the planner will:

#. Try to find a partner that matches the **criteria combination** and has never
   been called; then schedule a call for him.
#. If all matching partners have already been called, then search for matching
   partners that have not been called in the specified *Days gap*; then schedule a
   call for the one with least total scheduled calls.
#. If there is still no match, then schedule nothing and continue.
