This application allows you to track and schedule salespeople visits to your customers, allowing you to determine which opportunities are going to be dealt on each visit. Visits create an all day event in calendar, and they can be easily rescheduled.
Visits can be automatically created from a template, in which it is possible to select the frequency of visits, as well as the start and end dates. The last visit can also be calculated by selecting the total number of repetitions.
This module creates a cron that generates visits from templates, but an option to create them manually is available from the template form view when the template is validated.
