To use this module, you need to:

#. go to some partner as member of the group `Mailchimp / User`
#. on the mailchimp tab, assign as least an audience and possibly groups

Next time you push the list to mailchimp (either manually or via cronjob), this partner will be added or updated in the mailchimp audience.
