Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

1. Go to CRM --> Configuration --> Pipelines--> Stages
2. Check or uncheck "Show Won Button".

If you unchecked "Show Won Button", on that stage disappears Won Button.
Additionally, you won't be able to change to won stage from a stage with this configuration.

When installing the module, all CRM stages created are set by default to "Show Won Button".
